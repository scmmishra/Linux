## AWK
The awk command is a powerful method for processing or analyzing text filesâ€”in particular, data files that are organized by lines (rows) and columns.

Simple awk commands can be run from the command line. More complex tasks should be written as awk programs (so-called awk scripts) to a file.

The basic format of an awk command looks like this:
```
awk 'pattern {action}' input-file > output-file
```
This means: take each line of the input file; if the line contains the pattern apply the action to the line and write the resulting line to the output-file.

If the pattern is omitted, the action is applied to all line. For example:
```
awk '{ print $5 }' table1.txt > output1.txt
```
This statement takes the element of the 5th column of each line and writes it as a line in the output file "output.txt". The variable '$4' refers to the second column. Similarly you can access the first, second, and third column, with $1, $2, $3, etc. By default columns are assumed to be separated by spaces or tabs (so called white space). So, if the input file "table1.txt" contains these lines:
```
1, Justin Timberlake, Title 545, Price $7.30
2, Taylor Swift, Title 723, Price $7.90
3, Mick Jagger, Title 610, Price $7.90
4, Lady Gaga, Title 118, Price $7.30
5, Johnny Cash, Title 482, Price $6.50
6, Elvis Presley, Title 335, Price $7.30
7, John Lennon, Title 271, Price $7.90
8, Michael Jackson, Title 373, Price $5.50
```
Then the command would write the following lines to the output file "output1.txt":
```
545,
723,
610,
118,
482,
335,
271,
373,
```
If the column separator is something other than spaces or tabs, such as a comma, you can specify that in the awk statement as follows:
```
awk -F, '{ print $3 }' table1.txt > output1.txt
```
This will select the element from column 3 of each line if the columns are considered to be separated by a comma.

Therefore the output, in this case, would be:
```
Title 545
Title 723
Title 610
Title 118
Title 482
Title 335
Title 271
Title 373
```
The list of statements inside the curly brackets `('{','}')` is called a block. If you put a conditional expression in front of a block, the statement inside the block will be executed only if the condition is true.
```
awk '$7=="\$7.30" { print $3 }' table1.txt
```
In this case, the condition is `$7=="\$7.30"`, which means that the element at column 7 is equal to `$7.30`. The backslash in front of the dollar sign is used to prevent the system from interpreting $7 as a variable and instead take the dollar sign literally.

So this awk statement prints out the element at the 3rd column of each line that has a "$7.30" at column 7.

You can also use regular expressions as the condition. For example:
```
awk '/30/ { print $3 }' table1.txt
```
The string between the two slashes `('/')` is the regular expression. In this case, it is just the string "30." This means if a line contains the string "30", the system prints out the element at the 3rd column of that line. The output in the above example would be:
```
Timberlake,
Gaga,
Presley,
```
If the table elements are numbers awk can run calculations on them as in this example:
```
awk '{ print ($2 * $3) + $7 }'
```
Besides the variables that access elements of the current row `($1, $2, etc.)` there is the variable `$0` which refers to the complete row (line), and the variable NF which holds to the number of fields.

You can also define new variables as in this example:
```
awk '{ sum=0; for (col=1; col<=NF; col++) sum += $col; print sum; }'
```
This computes and prints the sum of all the elements of each row.

## SED
The Linux operating system makes use of terminal commands to work with a computer's file system. The primary use of the Linux command sed, which is short for stream editor, is to modify each line of a file or stream by replacing specified parts of the line. It makes basic text changes to a file or input from a pipeline. For example, say you have a file named "songs.text" that contains these lines:
```
1, Justin Timberlake, Title 545, Price $6.30
2, Taylor Swift, Title 723, Price $7.90
3, Mick Jagger, Title 610, Price $7.90
4, Lady Gaga, Title 118, Price $6.30
5, Johnny Cash, Title 482, Price $6.50
6, Elvis Presley, Title 335, Price $6.30
7, John Lennon, Title 271, Price $7.90
```
### Making Text Substitutions With Sed
If you want to change all price occurrences of $6.30 to $7.30, you can make the changes using the sed command in this way:
```
sed 's/6.30/7.30/' songs.txt > songs2.txt
```
This code makes the change and writes the modified file to "songs2.txt". The output file contains:
```
1, Justin Timberlake, Title 545, Price $7.30
2, Taylor Swift, Title 723, Price $7.90
3, Mick Jagger, Title 610, Price $7.90
4, Lady Gaga, Title 118, Price $7.30
5, Johnny Cash, Title 482, Price $6.50
6, Elvis Presley, Title 335, Price $7.30
7, John Lennon, Title 271, Price $7.90
```
If you want to replace all occurrences of "Cash" with "Trash" you use:
```
sed 's/Cash/Trash/' songs.txt > songs2.txt
```
which creates a file with content:
```
1, Justin Timberlake, Title 545, Price $7:30
2, Taylor Swift, Title 723, Price $7.90
3, Mick Jagger, Title 610, Price $7.90
4, Lady Gaga, Title 118, Price $7:30
5, Johnny Trash, Title 482, Price $6.50
6, Elvis Presley, Title 335, Price $7:30
7, John Lennon, Title 271, Price $7.90
```
### Filtering With the Sed Command
Sed is also frequently used to filter lines in a file or stream. For example, if you only want to see the lines containing "John," you use:

```
sed -n '/John/p' songs.txt > johns.txt
```
which writes the following lines to file johns.txt:
```
5, Johnny Trash, Title 482, Price $6.50
7, John Lennon, Title 271, Price $7.90
```
